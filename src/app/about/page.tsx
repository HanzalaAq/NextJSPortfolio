          Hello! I&apos;m a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating 
          beautiful and functional websites. I have experience working with various 
          technologies and frameworks, always striving to learn and improve my skills.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My journey in web development started 5 years ago, and since then, 
          I&apos;ve worked on numerous projects ranging from small business websites 
          to complex web applications. I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas 
          into reality through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, 
          contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book on software design.
